This is my B.Tech. major project on the topic skin lesion detection using CNN.
Me and my teammates have experimented with and utilized various Neural Networks to find the optimal model to solve our problem.
The Dataset used in this project is the HAM1000, published in Australia containing various images of different skin cancers along with other metadata like labels.
In the end after our thorough experimentation with RNNs and LSTMs as well we concluded to stick with CNN and build our model using it.
Our project also used various visualizations to easily understand how our models were performing.
Due to limited resources like GPU limit on Google Collab, we had to build our project on a smaller sample size that is only 500 random samples of different images.
We also used Data Augumentation to increase the diversity of our sample size for a better model creation.
All in all our project was successful and me and my teammates Wajhi and Shaibaz had a great time working on it.
